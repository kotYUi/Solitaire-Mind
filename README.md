My first experience in developing the Solitaire game: what happened and what I learned
Hi! This is my first experience developing a game, and I decided to share my impressions and the results of my work on the Solitaire project.

What's done:

The game â€œSolitaire" has been created on Unity.
The basic mechanics of the game are implemented.
Added a user interface (UI).
The main thing that I learned:

Game development requires a lot of time and effort.
It is important to plan the project in advance.
Working with Unity is interesting and exciting.
It is necessary to constantly learn and experiment.
Debugging code is an integral part of the development process.
First experience is valuable.:

This project has been a great experience for me. I learned a lot about game development, improved my programming skills, and had a lot of fun with the process. Of course, there are still many things that can be improved, but I'm happy with what happened in the end.

What's next:

In the future, I plan to continue studying game development and create new, more complex projects.

Thanks for your attention! I will be glad to receive any comments and suggestions.

For the guys who are just starting to study this area, it will be useful to familiarize themselves with this project.
